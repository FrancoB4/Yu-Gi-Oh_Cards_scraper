# Yu-Gi-Oh Cards Scraper
#### A simple script that extracts all important data of all Yu-Gi-Oh cards from the official Konami site 'Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Card Database'

### Configs:
- The URL of the page is: https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/?request_locale=en
- The script uses the Python Scrapy framework
- The script extracts the name, level (therefore, rank and link), type, ATK, DEF and description of each card (in spell or trap cards it only extracts what is necessary)

### Extra information:
- The value 'n / a' in any key represents 'not applicable', referring to the cards that do not have that key
- In the current state, the script can extract all the cards listed in the 'booster pack' entry in the page list (approximately 13000 cards)

### How that work?
#### Coming soon...
